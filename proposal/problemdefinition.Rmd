# The Problem
To keep up with latest advances in data intensive analyses and pipelines is central to keep R an attrictive alround data science eco-system. For anyone in the cummunity where CPU-time and/or in-memory size is a bottleneck, using multi-threaded polars with options for query optimization and out-of-memory execution can be a huge gain. Already, r-arrow exists, and likewise is based in the Apache Arrow memory format. The projects co-exist well and have near zero-copy conversion, making it fast to e.g. use a data connetion/driver from the other library. Polars currently have a stronger emphasis for multi-threaded computation, query optimization making it the current 'king of the hill' in a wide set of benchmarks. Rspark and sparklyr likewise provide similar functionality as polars. However polars is
